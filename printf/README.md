#INTRODUCTION TO "printf"
 1.the format string

At the core of printf is the format string. This string contains both text and format specifiers, which are placeholders for the values you want to print. Format specifiers start with a ‘%’ character, followed by a character that indicates the type of data to be printed (e.g., %d for integers, %s for strings).
